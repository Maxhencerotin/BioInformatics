You task for the project is to find different gene variants in each sample. 
Use only deer samples (files starting with J).

- A specific gene can have multiple variants in a genome

- For this project, MHC gene was sequenced using targeted sequencing, sequencing all available variants in a genome. 
  Remember that sequencing reads contain eror (for this technology, estimated error rate is 3%)

- Initially, use only the sequences of the most common length (296)

- Apply some clustering algorithm to sequences, we expect they will cluster around true gene variants

- For each cluster determine a representative sequence (this should be the true variant)

- For two samples (J29 and J30) you have ground truth, use those samples to adjust the parametes of your algorithm

- After that, apply the algorithm to all samples

- Most common lenght is 296bp, while ground truth for samples J29 and J30 is 249bp long. 
  This is beacuse sequencing reads contain additional bases (characters) at the start and end - sequencing primers.
  When comparing your results to the ground truth, keep this in mind.
